# Interacting with an issue
Let's add more issues

1.Documentation   

2.Data preprocessing 

3.Model selection

4.Building the model

5.Test model

Those are some basic steps that we will need to follow to accomplish our goal. Since you already know how to create issues, I will let you create an issue for each of these bullet points. After you are done, your Issues page should look like mine as shown below.

Before that, we can rename our repo from “to do” to something more data science. Bearing that in mind, I renamed mine to “basic model”, you can rename yours to anything you want.

To this just click on settings , as shown below, choose a different name and click on “rename”

Your issue page should look like mine, as shown below,

As you can see, the tasks are shown in the order in which they were introduced. There’s also no way to distinguish them except for their numbers, and it’s very easy to get lost if there are too many issues. , to have a clearer look at all our tasks, we are going to use Labels.

# Labels
Labels are exactly what you expect them to be: texts to help you quickly filter through your issues. Let’s use them directly so you can get familiar with the concept.

As you can see in the figure above, there is a search bar in the Issues page, and you can use it to filter through the issues. However, since we don’t have any labels yet, we can’t do any filtering; just basic search. Click the Labels button next to the search bar to show all the labels available. You will then see a list of the default labels that you can use; check the Figure below for an example of this.

Those are the most commonly used labels in the developers’ community. Still, that doesn’t mean that they are mandatory or immutable; you can change them at will. Only when you are working on an Open Source project is it ill-advised to change them because most developers are used to them.

Since it’s your personal project and you are the project manager, you can add, edit, or remove any label you want. For example, the label “help wanted” will be useless if you work alone in a private setting. You can also use labels to tag the severity of the issue; many projects use labels like “urgent” or “breaking” if the issue is severe. Labels can also be used to differentiate the origin of the issue if the project is big enough. A big project can use the labels “frontend,” “backend,” or “database” to separate issues into groups.

After you made your changes to the labels (although I recommend to only add the new that you need and leave the default ones), get back to your issues and open the details page. Then, apply one or more labels on each one of them by clicking the Labels button. You can check Figure below for an example.

After you add the labels, a notification will appear on the comment section of the Issues page; you can check the figure below  for an example.

Now, go through each one of your issues and apply some labels on them. Then, when you have finished, go back to the Issues page. It should look like mine (as shown below).

Isn’t labelling  fun?! You know what is even more fun? Assigning issues to others! Let’s do it.
